## Overview

I've been studying HTML and CSS for the past 3 months and I realized that I wasn't really practicing and when I tried to build something I would simply forget everything I learned. Because of that I decided to spend the next few months just doing challenges and practicing.

This is the easiest challenge on Frontend Mentor but it wasn't that easy for me. Doing things for the first time is never easy so what I decided was to build this challenge as many times as possible until I was comfortable with it and then do it on my own so here we are.

This is the first time doing this challenge completely on my own and trying to use git as well.

Thanks for reading this :D

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.
